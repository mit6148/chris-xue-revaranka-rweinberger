# beaver++

A Node.js-powered web app to trade products within the MIT community.

Inspired by the popular Facebook [Free & for Sale](https://www.facebook.com/groups/177075345746890/) group, this site is a buy/sell platform allowing users to upload, view, search for, and save products. It also includes a messaging feature, which allows users to easily carry out transactions with each other.

**beaver++** was made over IAP 2017 by Reva Ranka, Rebecca Weinberger, and Chris Xue as their final submission for the [6.148](http://6.148.scripts.mit.edu) web development competition. 

The site is live [here](http://dank6148.herokuapp.com/).

Enjoy!
